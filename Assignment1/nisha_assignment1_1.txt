I am a small-town girl from India with big aspirations in life. My name is Nisha Dayananda. I always believe, we can do anything if we set our mind to. I am an Information Management graduate student specializing in Data Analytics. I am halfway through my master's program. I am a quick learner ready to take on complex challenges and tackling them. 


I spend most of my time watching series on Netflix, Amazon Prime, and HBO. There is no particular genre I follow. Some of my favorite series is Game of Thrones, Silicon Valley, Breaking Bad, Baking Shows, etc. I am a big-time foodie so I love cooking and trying out different cuisines. I am always hungry for Sushi, Ethiopian food and Biriyani. 


I love taking pictures of everything around me. Also, I enjoy traveling, music and have visited a lot of places in India and the United States. One thing I like about the USA is how well the National Parks are maintained. I am from India so I really liked the fact how most of the places here are wheelchair accessible. I like hiking and camping too. 


Some of the other activities I enjoy are Zumba, Bootcamp, Pilates, and Yoga. I believe it is very important to be fit and make time for working out every day.
