  <h1>A brief introduction about me</h1>
  <h2>My background</h2>
    <p>I am a small-town girl from India with big aspirations in life. My name is Nisha Dayananda. I always believe, we can do anything if we set our mind to. I am an Information Management graduate student specializing in Data Analytics. I am halfway through my master's program. I am a quick learner ready to take on complex challenges and tackling them.</p>

    <h3>Some of the things I enjoy doing</h3>
    I spend most of my time watching series on 
   <ul>
    <li>Netflix</li>
    <li>Amazon Prime</li>
    <li> HBO </li>
   </ul>
   There is no particular genre I follow. Some of my favorite series are
   <ul>
       <li>Game of Thrones</li>
    <li>Silicon Valley</li>

    I am a big-time foodie so I love cooking and trying out different cuisines. I am always hungry for
    <ul>
     <li>Sushi</li>

    I love taking pictures of everything around me. Also, I enjoy traveling, music and have visited a lot of places in India and the United States. One thing I like about the USA is how well the National Parks are maintained. I am from India so I really liked the fact how most of the places here are wheelchair accessible. I like hiking and camping too.</p>
